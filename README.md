# Twitter_News_Bot
A Java program I created to automatically post the top US headlines to Twitter every four hours via a Raspberry Pi and the Cron scheduler.

Special thanks the org.JSON library for the easier handling of JSON data, and special thanks to newsapi.org and Twitter4j.com for providing their REST API and library, respectively, for use by the public. Twitter4J is not included in this repository, but you may get it here as it is required to run the program properly: http://twitter4j.org/en/.
